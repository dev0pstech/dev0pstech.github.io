## Configure Chirpy to Display Page View

Once all the hard part is done, it is very easy to enable the Page View on Chirpy theme. Your superProxy dashboard should look something like below and you can grab the required values.

![superproxy-dashboard](test.png){: width="1210" height="694"}

Another display of image without the width and height

![superproxy-dashboard](test.png){: width="1210" height="694"}
